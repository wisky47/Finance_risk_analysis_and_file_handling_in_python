Libraries and their uses in the Project

PANDAS            
: library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis

NUMPY             
: library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

DATETIME          
: format datetime ... The way date and time is represented may be different in different places, organizations etc. It's more common to use mm/dd/yyyy

PATHLIB           
: makes it very easy and efficient to deal with file paths

PANDASQL          
: allows you to query pandas DataFrames using SQL syntaxis an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Seaborn works easily with dataframes and the Pandas library.

COLLECTIONS       
: basically container data types, namely lists, sets, tuples, dictionary. They have different characteristics based on the declaration and the usage.

MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT 
: ploting graphs

SEABORN
: is an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Seaborn works easily with dataframes and the Pandas library.

SKLEARN
: machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines

CSV
: implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.

OS 
: This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

GC
: garbage collector
